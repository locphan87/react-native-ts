# Higher order components

A higher-order component ([HOC](https://reactjs.org/docs/higher-order-components.html)) is an advanced technique in React for reusing component logic.

Concretely, a higher-order component is a function that takes a component and returns a new component.

```js
const EnhancedComponent = higherOrderComponent(WrappedComponent);
```
